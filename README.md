## Summary

This project is a continuation of the C++
[CavalierContours](https://github.com/jbuckmccready/CavalierContours) library rewritten in Rust with
the goal of building out more functionality, better documentation, and creating a stable C FFI.
This project has all of the functionality of the C++ repository with more code documentation, test
coverage, and some additional functions for working with polylines. For tracking progress and
contributing checkout the project GitHub issues. For more information about the parallel offset
algorithm and background information see the old C++ repository `README.md`
[here](https://github.com/jbuckmccready/CavalierContours).

This library uses no unsafe code (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is applied) in the main
`cavalier_contours` crate. Unsafe is used in the `cavalier_contours_ffi` crate for C bindings.

## Interactive Web Page for Visualizing and Testing


> [!NOTE]  
> This is the old web demo ui page. The new page built with egui is [here](https://jbuckmccready.github.io/cavalier_contours/).

This project is compiled to wasm to create an interactive web demo page for visualing and testing.

## Why go to Rust?

- All the same benefits of using C or C++ (great performance/optimizations, native compile, no
  garbage collection, no run time) for creating fast portable libraries with a C FFI
- Great builtin tooling around builds and packages (cargo + crates)
- Great builtin tooling for writing and maintaining tests
- All of the great builtin tooling makes open source contribution and participation easier to
  facilitate
- Borrow checker + lifetimes allow for more advanced memory allocation optimizations without the
  risk of memory errors/corruption bugs
- Type system allows for leaning heavily on threads/concurrency without the risk of memory
  errors/corruption bugs
- Discriminated unions and pattern matching as first class language features
- Great tooling for targeting wasm

## New to Rust but still want to contribute?

I recommend the official rust book [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html).
Visual Studio Code + [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension work great for editing.
